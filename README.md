==================

Zoko is a simple 3D puzzle game that can be played in any modern web browser supporting WebGL. The basic idea of the game is based on the popular game often called [Sokoban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban),
 with the difference being that this version is played in 3D.

The objective of the game is to move all boxes to indicated platforms in as few steps as possible.
